## Why Does This Exist?
Tired of spending countless hours every week deciding what to cook, my wife and I sought a solution. Instead of endlessly scrolling through a notepad app on our phones, I decided to streamline the process through programming.

## What Does It Do?
The meal planner offers users a convenient platform to catalog their favorite recipes. When it's time for grocery shopping, users can select the meals they plan to make for the week. The tool then compiles all the necessary ingredients, making the shopping trip efficient and hassle-free.

## How Do I Use It?
Each user can select a unique 4-digit meal plan ID. With this ID, users can create their own recipes or duplicate recipes from other users. The meal plan ID is shareable, enabling families to coordinate their meals for the week or organize their grocery list collaboratively.
