## Why Does This Exist?
Tired of spending countless hours every week deciding what to cook, my wife and I sought a solution. Instead of endlessly scrolling through a notepad app on our phones, I decided to streamline the process through programming.

## What Does It Do?
The meal planner offers users a convenient platform to catalog their favorite recipes. When it's time for grocery shopping, users can select the meals they plan to make for the week. The tool then compiles all the necessary ingredients, making the shopping trip efficient and hassle-free.
